## Simple Real Chat App

This is an example of a simple real chat app made with the Firebase Real-Time DB and React as a frontend framework.

We are going to use Firebase as is a suite of tools used frequently for building client apps,reporting analytics and hosting services.We are going to be mainly interested in the realtime database that it provides a is a NoSQL db capable to update in real time.We are also going to use the authentication service to let users the option to sign in with their email and password or with other ways such as with their Facebook,Twitter or Google account.
In Firebase we'll create a project and after it finishes creating it we'll register firebase to an web app giving it a name and register it.Then we'll have to copy the Firebase SDK to enable the Firebase service.
For the authentication part we'll enable the authentication option from the Authentication tab in the Firebase dashboard and we'll select the email/password(later on we'll implement another authentication using Google or Github).

# Setting the structure of our web app

For this particular web app we'll be using React and NodeJS.
We'll use the `create-react-app` module to create the structure of a functional React app.
Command: `npx create-react-app simple-chat`
This command we'll create the basic structure and install all the necessary dependencies in our package.json file.
We'll also need some addtional packages like Firebase for our authentication system and React-router-dom because our web app we'll be using multiple pages(views).
Command: `yarn add react-router-dom firebase`

To start the application we'll use: `yarn start`.
This starts a development server and opens a default React page in your default browser.The page will open in: `localhost:3000`.

For our web app will have the following structure in our src directory:
- /components: contains reusable widgets used in different pages
- /helpers: contains some reusable functions
- /pages: will contain the application views
- /services: third-party services that weâ€™re using ~ Firebase
- App.js: the root component

We'll start adding the firebase service creating an firebase.js file in our services directory import firebase and then adding the firebase configuration,initializing firebase and then exporting the authentication and database modules.
Then we'll import the dependencies in our App.js file. We'll import React and other modules necessary especially for the page-flow(routing) of our web application and then importing the pages of our application that we'll later implement.

# Application routing

We'll have to create some high-order components in order to mantain the public and private routes separate.
This component will wrap a <Route>,pass props from the router to the <Route>, render the component depending on the authenticated state and redirect the user to another route if he doesn't pass the conditions.
The PrivateRoute component will receive three props,the first being the component to render, the authenticated state and the rest of th e parameters passed to the router. It will check if the authenticated state is true and render the component or else will redirect the user to the login view.
The PublicRoute component is similar to the other one,it will render the component if the authentication is set to false or else will redirect it to the chat view.
Then will set the logic routing to our app.We'll use our previously defined methods to set the routing of our app,creating private route components for our chat view and public route components for our signup and signin views,the home view will also be public.

Then we'll have to write the logic to see if a user is authenticated or not.At first we'll set the initial state of our application and then we'll use the componentDidMount hook to keep checking if the user is authenticated or not.We'll also use the getDerivedStateFromError to register any error that can occur.
Firebase provides a method: onAuthStateChanged that keeps records of the authentication state.If the user exists we'll register authenticated as true.

To register the users will provide a series of methods that will be located in our helpers directory.We will,at first, have two methods: signup and signin,the first one will create a new user using its email and password and the second one will log in an existing user with the email and password.
Next thing we need to do is creating the Sign up page adding a simple form with two fields: email and password.
To handle the change or submit of the form we need set the initial state of the component and bind the methods to the components scope.
For the handleChange method used for the modifications on the forms fields we use computed properties to pair up state variables to their values.
For the handleSubmit we prevent default submissons then use the signup function.

The signin page is similar to the signup page.We'll use the signin method to let the user sign in.
We can also allow users to authenticate using their Google Account or Github account.

To do that we'll have to enable this sigin option in our Firebase dashboard and add the localhost domain to the whitelist list to prevent spam.
We'll create and export the sign in function in our helpers directory using a signInWithPopup method that we'll act as a intermediate with Google before redirecting him back to the app.
Then we'll add this option to our signup page, creating the onClick handler and then bind the handler to the component.

To use the Github sigin method we'll need to get the app authorization callback URL from firebase and then register our app on Github to get the client id and client secret.
Then we'll add the signInWithGithub method to the helpers directory similar to the google sigin.
After that we'll import this metho to the signup page and add a new button with that option.Then we'll add the click handler and the binder to the component just as in the previous google one.


For our database we'll use the Realtime Database that Firebase offers the other possibility being the Cloud Firestore.Both of which are NoSQL databases.
For our database we'll have a chat node with some children. We'll have to say that the R/W rules will apply only to authenticated users.
We'll create a Chat.js view that will represent our chatroom page.
In the componentDidMount method we reference the chat node in our database using db.ref("chat"),listening to the event value which will be added to the chat node.What is returned from the database is an array-like object that we loop through and push each object into an array,setting the chat state variable to the resulting array value.Using the on connection between the client and Firebase means that the value will be added in real time without the need to refresh the page.
Finally will render our chat putting the chat content and timestamp and also the currently logged in user.
To be able to send messages will need a form with a input field that would accept a message and a send button.For that will add a form,the value of the input field is bound to our state variable content and we'll call the handleChange when its value changes.
To submit the form we'll call the handleSubmit handler that we'll prevent any previous errors and then create a reference to the chat node in our database and push a new unique pair with the content, timestamp and the user id that wrote the content and also we'll have to clear the content for our next push to be empty.
Finally we'll bind our handler to the component.
